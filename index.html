            Traffic jam is the situation when vehicles are stopped completely for some time period on the roads. Also, vehicles have to wait for a long time to move out of the jam. Sometimes it becomes like congestion in traffic. This happens in transport network due to the increasing vehicles and overuse of roads. Often it is due to slow speed, longer trip time and increased queues of vehicles. Therefore, traffic jam is becoming a major issue mostly in all cities.

            Let us discuss some major problems that arise due to high traffic:</p>
         <p>
            Traffic is one of the major problems in cities and has made the lives of people really difficult. Obviously, it results in non-productive activity.
            People experience delays for their important work. This may even result in personal as well as professional losses.
            It is also the main cause of wastage of fuels and air pollution.
            It increases stress and frustration among motorists and passengers.
            Unsafe driving is the main impact of traffic jam which may lead to road mishaps and hence injuries.
            Traffic jams can also have a negative impact on the mind of a person. The traffic congestion and constant blowing of horns create excessive noise pollution.

    <p>
        Traffic signal: Traffic signal is automated or sometimes manual signal at a junction or crossroad in a high traffic area designed for a smooth flow of traffic without jams. This sounds great in theory, but the only problem here is that even if one person doesnâ€™t follow the rules of a traffic signal, then it can cause traffic jams at such junctions. The three traffic signals are colour coded,  which are red, yellow and green. Traffic signal poles will display these signs in front of the vehicle

            Footways or footpaths (including any path along the side of a road) should be used if provided. Where possible, avoid being next to the kerb with your back to the traffic. If you have to step into the road, look both ways first. Always show due care and consideration for others.
